# Swastik Hospital Branding

This app is branded for **Swastik Hospital**. To use your own logo:

1. **Login page (top logo)**  
   Replace `swastikLogo.png` in this folder with your Swastik Hospital logo (recommended size: small/icon, e.g. 200–300px wide).

2. **Footer logo (login and login location pages)**  
   Replace `swastikLogoFull.png` with your full Swastik Hospital logo (e.g. horizontal logo with text).

Placeholder copies were created from the original images. Overwrite them with your Swastik Hospital logo files (same names) to complete the branding.

**Optional:** To set the logo via configuration (e.g. for the login location page), configure `loginPage.logo` in your `bahmni_config` (OpenMRS config).
